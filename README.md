Here are some equation we use in this program:

Average waiting time for a customer = Total time customer waiting in Queue/ Total number of customers
The average time of a customer spend in system = total time spend in system/ total customer
The average time between arrivals = sum of all time between arrivals / number of arrival-1
The average service time = total service time/ total number of customer
The proportion of the idle time of the server = total idle time of server/total run time of simulation.
